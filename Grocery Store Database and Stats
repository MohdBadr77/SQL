--First I created the table

create table simplistic (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Frame_size TEXT, quantity INTEGER, price INTEGER);

-- Below im inserting the values into my table which include the product type,quantity,and price)

INSERT INTO simplistic VALUES (1,"A2",3,20);
INSERT INTO simplistic VALUES (2,"A3",4,30);
INSERT INTO simplistic VALUES (3,"A4",7,50);
INSERT INTO simplistic VALUES (4,"A5",2,100);
INSERT INTO simplistic VALUES (5,"A6",8,60);

--Below im showing the outcome where I arranged the table to order the type of products which brought the most revenue, by multiplying the quantity * price and then orderd them from the highest



SELECT  Frame_size AS Frame_Size
,sum(quantity) AS Quantity
,sum(price) As Price
,sum(price*quantity) AS TOTAL
FROM simplistic
GROUP BY Frame_size
ORDER BY sum(price*quantity) desc;

--Below is a question where I'm answering what are the 2 most popular products where they sell the most (If we have around 1000 products then I can easily figure out the top ones and also limit them to whatever number is required, for this small table will only limit it to 2)

SELECT* FROM simplistic
ORDER BY quantity desc
limit 2;

-- so then I know that product A6 and A4 are the most popular.
